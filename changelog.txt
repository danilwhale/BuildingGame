---------------------------------

0.0.2-prealpha - random shit update (10.03.2023)
*DO NOT EVEN DARE DELETE assets FOLDER, YOU'LL REGARD THIS*
- added 30 new tiles
- added settings (sky color changing and toggle for dynamic tiles)
- added dynamic tiles (optionally enables physic for sand, flow for water and lava, obsidian creation)
- now game uses new world format (bgworld2 instead of lvl)
- - old worlds can be loaded and be converted to bgworld2, backup will always sit in folder
- - it's heavy though
- added tooltip for tiles in tile menu
- changed font from helvetipixel to homespun
- added loading screen (it's real)
- added tile rotation (press R to rotate) (reason why game needs new world format)

*i'm tired*
